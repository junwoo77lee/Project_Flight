# Project-Flight

### Objective

Create a site that utilized Avaitions Edge API to display flight data, allowing the user to interact with a flight map.  We wanted to provide the user with high level flight data, general airport information and interactive charts to explore the dataset.

### Purpose/Goal

Avaiation Edge API provides several connections into airport data.  This project focused on creative ways to explore arrival and departure data.  By target the top 61 Airports, according to Wikipedia, the goal is to present data in a user friendly way allowing for the visual exploration of the flight data for a given time and airport.

### Conclusion

Airline, Airport and Avaition data allows for the opportunity to explore so many data points it can be challenging to pick the most relevant information as well as to not continue growing a project scope.  With further development and targeting this project could allow for users to create potentially paid offerings to both travelers and aiports.
